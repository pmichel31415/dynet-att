when steve lopez , the los angeles times , one day went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , UNK , UNK , who played on a violin that only had two strings .
many of you will know the story , because of UNK articles on it , a book became a book , which was UNK , with robert UNK junior , as steve sillett and la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
UNK left UNK , suffered a UNK and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless man on the streets of UNK row at the center of los angeles .
i 'm going to tell you all about reading the book or watching the film , so that you do n't just understand the wonderful richness that came between those two men , but also how the music makes this connection , and how it is that the music is able to get the UNK
i met mr UNK in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall hall .
he had just heard a demo of UNK first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
he talked in a very UNK and UNK sound of yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers could never create in the baseball world . and this is all about the UNK of the first episode of UNK fourth EOS .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email in which i stood for UNK UNK .
i have to mention that UNK is a medical treatment , because he was already treated with UNK and UNK and UNK , a trauma that had been tracked his whole life .
and as a result of that , he 's particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , which are sometimes so bad , and he goes back in the streets of UNK row , always subjected to this horror and the UNK of his own mind .
and in fact , a UNK was UNK when we started working with our first decade in walt disney hall hall , and he had this insane asylum out of his eyes , and appeared .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison him in the sleeping .
i was scared , not knowing , but i was scared that i could lose it in one of his states , and that i could destroy him to the violin , when i started to talk about UNK and UNK and other exciting forms of UNK UNK .
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of UNK UNK .
and as i played , i realized that in UNK eyes , a whole change was going on .
it was as if he stood under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose catalyst was my game .
UNK , anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and UNK .
and as a wonder he took his violin , and he started to play some clips of UNK , and asked me to play it at the end : UNK , UNK , UNK .
and we started talking about music , starting from bach UNK , UNK , UNK , and all the other UNK , from UNK to UNK .
and i realized that he did n't just have a UNK of knowledge about music , but also with her a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i 'd only know from my colleague in the united states of los angeles .
by playing music and spoke about music , it was from this UNK , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a UNK , UNK , UNK , in UNK .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for UNK , music means health .
because the music allows him to make his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he UNK his UNK states .
i realized that this is the nature of art .
and this is why we do music : we have something that 's in all of us , deep inside of us , our emotions , through our artistic lens through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression hit us all , and moves , inspired and unites us .
UNK UNK , so it brought him back into a community of friends .
the UNK power of music took him back into a family of musicians who understood that he realized his talent and was growing it .
and i 'm going to play UNK music again , whether in walt disney hall came hall , or in UNK row , because he reminds me why i am musicians .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i 've stolen the UNK .
i hope you excuse me .
so i saw a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , it was more like an passionate UNK .
it was a beautiful fish , UNK , UNK UNK , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in UNK after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with a relationship over several months .
one day , the head of the company called the company , and i asked if i could say in an event about sustainability 's farm .
`` of course , '' i said .
this was a company trying to solve what this incredible problem for our chefs is , how do we keep fish on our UNK ?
in the past 50 years , we 've seen the ocean as we have UNK forests .
it 's hard to get the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing left .
so it will be or perhaps UNK , UNK , part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it . UNK the environment , most of them anyway , and they 're inefficient , take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a UNK from 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of UNK is necessary to get a pounds of UNK .
not very sustainable .
it does n't taste very well .
so here finally , a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the boss ' head for the company .
let 's see him see .
`` UNK , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous to grow so far out in the sea , that you do n't have the environment . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the midden workers are distributed from our fish , not focused . ''
and then he said , `` we 're essentially a world .
this UNK of UNK , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
UNK , great .
`` UNK to one ? what feeds her ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said .
and that night i was in bed , and i thought , what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , a UNK . EOS
i said , `` well , what are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said he did n't know that . he will go back .
well , i UNK with a few people in the company , no one could give me a damn answer , until i finally grew up with the senior biologists .
we also call it a UNK .
`` UNK , '' i said , `` what are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned some algae and some UNK , and then he said , `` UNK . ''
i said , `` UNK ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , skin , UNK , UNK and UNK . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your UNK is chicken ? ''
in fact , maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what 's sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? ''
there was a long break in the leadership , and he said , `` there 's just too much chicken in the world . ''
i UNK myself from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a UNK UNK and UNK .
that 's actually me .
no , i actually have UNK from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish , after this conversation , has chicken .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of UNK .
it 's the romantic way that you know , the better you learn to know your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him first in a restaurant in UNK .
a UNK journalist has talked about this fish for a long time .
it 's got us in a way .
he came on the table with a light , almost UNK white color .
the chef had UNK him .
wait twice .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good after he got UNK ?
i ca n't , but this guy can .
let 's call it miguel . it 's actually miguel .
and no , he does n't have a cook , and he 's not a chef . at least in the way that you and i understand .
he 's a biologist in UNK la la la la la la la la la
this is a UNK in the UNK corner .
it 's close to the flow of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of UNK .
they domesticated UNK on what was essentially wetlands .
they did this by UNK the country .
they built this complicated episode of canals , and they UNK water out of the country , and out of the river .
well , they were n't able to make it work , not economically .
and green was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so 1982 , a spanish company has bought the country .
what did they do ?
you have the flow of the water vice .
they literally have the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to UNK the water back again .
they UNK the channels .
they created a 11,000 frames of UNK -- UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK -- and they were miguel , and the environmental destruction completely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything like this .
they 're looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are UNK channels and these density , a solid march .
i was there not a long time ago by miguel .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of `` a UNK to kiss . ''
okay ? there we were and fought through the wetlands and i fought , and i went and UNK , i got dirt to my knee , and miguel ruins in quiet .
this is where he puts a rare UNK .
now he mentioned the UNK of phytoplankton .
and here , he sees a pattern of UNK that remembered it at the UNK pandemic .
it turns out miguel the largest part of his career in UNK national park in africa .
i asked him how he had become a UNK .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert on relationships . ''
and then he goes and falls into more UNK of rare birds and algae and weird UNK .
and do n't get me wrong , that was really intriguing , you know , the UNK community , that 's the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this UNK piece of UNK fish that i had on the UNK .
so i interrupted it . i said , `` miguel , how does your fish eat so good ? ''
he showed the algae .
`` i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's incredible .
but what food ?
how is the UNK ? ''
well , he 's driving me to tell me that it 's such a beautiful system that the fish eat what they were eating in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the UNK , that 's what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely UNK .
there 's no food .
depending on a farm that does n't feed her animals ?
and then later on this site , i went around with miguel nicolelis , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place that seems to be so of course , '' unlike any farm that i 've ever been , `` how measured you success ? ''
at the moment , it was as if a UNK would have a UNK .
and we took the corner around the corner , and we offered the most incredible picture , thousands and thousands of marshes , literally , literally , a whole UNK of the eye .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look at your UNK , pink .
it UNK . ''
UNK ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , do n't you use your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and UNK to the birds .
well , last year on this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it 's the largest and one of the most important private sector in europe .
i said , `` miguel , is n't a good UNK UNK , not the last thing you want to have on a UNK ? ''
he shook his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building UNK , not hard .
this is a global network .
the flamingos feed the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so depending on the belly , the better the system . ''
okay , let 's think about this . a farm that does n't feed its animals , and a farm that measure their success on the health of their predators .
a UNK , but also a UNK .
oh , and by the way , these outbreaks of hell should not be there .
they breed in a city UNK miles where the UNK is better for the UNK .
every morning they fly UNK miles per farm .
and they fly UNK miles away .
they do it because they can follow the UNK white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had imagined a kind of UNK journey , so i started miguel . EOS
i said , `` miguel , fly UNK miles to the farm , and then fly UNK miles away at night ?
do you do that for children ? ''
he looked at me when i was quoted a song from whitney houston .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i did n't mention the skin of my loved fish , which was delicious , and i do n't like UNK . i do n't like it . i do n't like it .
it 's this UNK , UNK flavor .
i 'm almost never going to cook it .
and yet , when i put them in this restaurant in UNK , they do n't even have UNK UNK .
she liked it , and it was as if you would take a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned that against miguel , and he UNK .
he said , `` the skin works like a sponge .
it 's the last resistance to get into the body .
it evolved over evolution to UNK UNK . ''
and then he said , `` but our water does n't have UNK . ''
okay . a farm that does n't feed her fish , a farm that measure their success at the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says a farm that does n't have a UNK , he 's a big , because the water that comes through that farm comes from the river .
it 's a flow that leads all of the things that rivers tend to lead , they tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , flow from UNK .
and when it 's fought through the system , and it leaves the water clean , it 's cleaner , as it UNK .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only a farm that does n't feed its animals , not just a farm that is given their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a UNK , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water UNK , it 's in the atlantic .
a drop of the ocean , i know , but i 'll take it , and you should also do it , because these UNK , as romantic as , is also telling . EOS
you might say it 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we 're talking about UNK or UNK .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , actually .
but for many people , it 's a little too radical .
we 're not UNK ; we 're UNK . we 're lover .
we love UNK . we love little UNK . we talk about regional food . we eat food .
and if you argue that these are the things that tell the future of good food , somebody says somewhere and says , `` hey people , i love pink flamingos , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we are producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are going to die today .
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of the inequalities in the distribution , not the UNK .
well , i do n't like this question because it has the logic of our past over the past 50 years .
a grain of corn , UNK of UNK , chemicals on earth , chicken in fish , and the whole time has just asked agribusiness , `` if we feed more people cheaper , how bad can it be ? ''
this was the UNK . it was the UNK . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should be calling them what it is , a radios inside of UNK , a craft that does n't allow you to make it , which allows the production of that production .
it 's not a craft , and it 's not agriculture .
our UNK is under threat today , not because of UNK UNK , but by UNK resources .
not by the latest UNK and UNK , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by chainsaws , but by UNK , and not by UNK and nets , and not by UNK and nets , but through the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let 's start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , do n't look at the UNK for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never made something really good for food .
instead , let 's look at the ecological model .
this is what it is about two billion years ago .
look miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not worlds , businesses , UNK , rather than UNK , businesses , the UNK , rather than just UNK , farmers who are not only UNK , but experts for relationships .
because they are the people who are experts in flavor .
and if i 'm really honest , they 're a better chef than i will be .
you know , that 's right , because if that 's the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to share one thing today , it is that the totality of the data that we consume is larger than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about UNK , i think you can think about how we can use information to make the pattern , and we see the trends that might not be
so , what we see here is a typical UNK of UNK .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it 's called UNK , and what i can do with UNK is that i can filter up after a certain cause of death , say crashes .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes .
and that 's because in the UNK , the people are on the UNK , and they 're over here on the UNK .
we can go out one step further and put the data back and see that UNK and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
if we go further and look at age , we say 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are actually the leading cause that people should worry about .
and who knows that this is true in men .
so you can see that this looks at information and data in this way very much in swimming in a living memory .
and if we can do this for raw data why not for the content itself ?
so what we have here are the UNK of every single `` UNK UNK '' which have ever been printed .
it 's all here . it 's all online .
you 'd like to test it after my talk .
you can get it into a decade .
you can get into a particular year .
they can jump directly to a particular sequence .
if i look at this , i see the athletes who appear in this copy and the sports .
i 'm an lance scary fan , so i 'm going to put all the spending in which lance armstrong will be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a UNK overview , i could say , `` ok , what if i look at the topic ? ''
so i go back a step back and make the view .
now i see greg UNK .
and so you get an idea of that if you look at this kind of information , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , you do n't look at it or not just .
you make something that 's actually slightly different .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i 'd like to take this idea a little further at what a little crazy is .
what we 've done here is , we 've taken every single UNK , and it 's reduced to a little bit .
so the ipcc are UNK and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i 'll just show you the top 500 of the popular UNK .
but even in this case , we can do a lot of things .
right now , we get a sense of the topics that are at wikipedia .
i 'm going to choose the topic of UNK .
now , after i elected UNK , i know that the UNK that most of the year are `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in one individual UNK .
it 's only to see when you take a step back and look at it .
but on a certain one of these rides , i can go into the theme of time , `` people of the year '' go in , and see all together .
now , if i look at all these individuals , i know that the majority of these are UNK . some of them come from science . some of them , come from the economy . here 's my boss , and one comes from the UNK .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump onto and look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we 're surfing on the web the first time it 's actually a web , not just from side , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you what else might be a little surprise .
i 'll just show you the new york times website .
UNK , this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's not a browser , but you can look at the web pages , and we get these UNK to every single website like this .
so i can go back a step back and jump directly to a specific UNK .
and that 's why , because you only have to look at the web of websites in this way that can look at all the UNK in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my lab in a particular time .
here 's the state of the entire demonstration that i 've done until this time .
and i can sort of know anything i 've seen today , again .
and when i go back to a step back and look at everything , i can unlock my trajectory , perhaps after my UNK , and here , i looked for UNK , here after bing — or here to live in UNK .
and from here i can go into the side and put it back .
it 's a metaphor that is used over again , and every time it makes it much greater than the sum of the UNK .
right now , in this world , we think data is a curse .
we 're talking about the curse of the UNK .
we 're talking about `` drowning in information . ''
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going to go to the other , we start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that otherwise had remained stuck ?
if we can do this , it will be a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of moving just in information , we can get out of it .
and if we know , we may be able to pull away from that .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a UNK of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school to school , every day one hour per hour .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a UNK that my thought in other worlds , and in a way , my deep UNK in me , voracious insect predators .
and this curiosity turned out that whenever i was n't in school , when i was n't in school , i went through the forests , walked and `` samples , '' frogs and snakes and beetles , all came home and looked at the microscope .
i was totally UNK , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and to understand the limits of the world .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his amazing shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonders that we had never had before .
and it would be very good at the UNK UNK .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games , and with computer-generated films , still the whole images of the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
we all had to do that back at the time , when we were able to read a book , we took the description of the UNK and UNK it on the screen in our heads .
my response was drawing and draw from aliens , alien worlds , robots , UNK and all that like that .
in mathematics , i was always caught by the teacher , like i hid in the textbook , UNK .
creativity had to get out of it .
and something interesting happened , which was fascinated me in jacques UNK shows , the thought of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never reach a alien world with a spacecraft , which seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all that i had always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i decided . EOS
the only problem is that i lived in a small village in canada , UNK miles away from the next ocean .
but i did n't let myself invisible that .
i UNK my father , until he finally got a UNK in UNK , new york , which was found exactly on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my UNK in a pool of UNK in the middle of the winter in UNK , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i only got two years later when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that are now UNK , i spent about $ 10,000 hours of water , 500 hours of it in UNK .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the UNK oceans , is so rich in UNK life , how we can really imagine .
the nature of nature does n't know borders , rather unlike our own , human imagination .
in the past days , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my UNK .
and my love to the ocean , with the same intensity as it and the .
when i was a grown-up , when i was a grown-up , it was UNK .
that seemed the best way to tell stories , to tell stories with my need to create pictures .
as a child , i used to play UNK and so forth .
so movies were the way , images and stories , and it worked together .
of course , the stories i UNK myself from , `` terminator , '' `` terminator , '' `` space , '' and `` UNK . ''
in `` UNK '' i was able to combine my UNK for the UNK , and i connect with the UNK .
so both my two passions are .
something interesting happened at `` UNK '' : to solve a UNK problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid UNK -- we got to create animation , UNK , UNK , back .
what came out of that was the first computer-generated whistle that ever had in a film .
the film did n't have a money , just in fact , he just played his production capability , but i realized something amazing : the audience around the world was like UNK from the magic that was coming from .
when arthur clarke 's law , we know , we are very UNK technology , and magic is not UNK .
so they saw something magic .
and that 's what i found . EOS
and i thought , `` wow , this must be involved in the UNK . ''
so we went to `` terminator two , '' my next film , much more .
together with UNK , we made the guy out of liquid metal , and the success was entirely off how this effect would hit .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing . however , we have a little more money .
from these two experiences , we 've reached a whole world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i founded a company together with my good friend UNK winston , who was the best UNK and UNK . she was called `` digital UNK . ''
the general idea of this company was that the phase of UNK processes with visual UNK , etc. , and we 're starting to skip the digital UNK .
we also did that , and we gave us an advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the '90s , we realized that we were in the UNK and UNK -- which we actually founded the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece of avatar , which was the UNK in things of visual effects and UNK effects in all new heights , with lifelike human , expressive characters that had been made by UNK , and the world should be UNK . and the world should be UNK . and the world should be UNK .
but they put it back , and the people in my company told me that we could n't be able to do that .
so i shifted that and made this other film about the big ship , which is lost .
i 've been reading this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship , '' it was a UNK UNK , a passionate film .
but secretly , i did n't want to reintroduce the real train on the titanic .
that 's why i made the film .
that 's the truth . the studio did n't know that .
but i convinced them by saying , `` we come to the wreckage . we movies the real train . EOS
we will show it in the UNK of the movie .
it 's hugely important . it 's a good UNK for marketing . ''
and i UNK them to fund a big number .
sounds crazy , but it goes back to that your imagination can create reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i was in a russian UNK 1977 , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i had the real titanic through a UNK .
this was n't a film , no UNK , that was real .
so that really blew me away .
and the setting up there was huge . we had to build cameras and light and stuff .
and i fell on , like a lot of these UNK , a UNK .
well , they were also UNK and UNK of planning .
you go up in these capsule , then you put it into this dark , hostile environment where no hope is to rescue , if you ca n't get it back .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's just as if i 'm in a UNK .
it 's really cool . ''
i was really obsessed with the deep sea .
anyway , from the part that has to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure ; it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could n't give me hollywood to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i could n't imagine what i would see outside of the UNK .
in some of the following expeditions i 've seen creatures in UNK , and sometimes things i 've never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , i had no words . EOS
so that 's what i really got right now , and i wanted to go .
and so i hit a very unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic , '' i said , `` okay , i want to put my UNK as a filmmaker in hollywood to ice and i 'm going to UNK for a while . ''
and then we started , we came to the UNK , and we explored it with UNK . EOS
we went back to the beam of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which had a UNK UNK .
our intent was to look at the inside of the ship , which never had been done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the brain , and you had no resources for that . so we developed the technology .
well , i 'm sitting here , on the deck of the titanic , in a UNK , and i see the UNK that these UNK look quite similar , and i know that once the band played there .
and i fly a little UNK through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm not going to do it , but my consciousness is within the car .
it felt like i 'd be in the UNK of the titanic .
this was the UNK form of a UNK that i 've ever experienced , because before i took a corner , i always knew what was going on in the UNK of the car , because i went back to the UNK , when we turned the film .
the set was a exact replica of the ship of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
and she made me realize that you can use these UNK avatars and that your own consciousness in the vehicle can move into that other form of existence .
it was really quite profound .
and perhaps a little view of what might happen in some decades , if you have UNK , to try to explore or to explore or do other things , in all sorts of UNK that i can imagine . EOS
so after this examination , we began to really appreciate what we saw in the bottom , for example , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals -- that 's kind of aliens , but here 's UNK .
they live with UNK .
they do n't exist in a sunlight where we do it .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees c that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in UNK , which was again from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do that with nasa , and they 're sitting in the UNK , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go through the mission , and they go through and
that was fascinating .
but at the end , i ran out that i took the deep sea into the deep sea .
and i took them with , and i took them access to the world there : UNK , UNK , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could take the data and take the data and take the instruments and look at the instruments , and they
we did displacement , but actually science , in particular , said , `` UNK .
so , the circle of my existence as a UNK , as a child , and the UNK into reality .
i 've learned a lot about this all the time .
i 've learned a lot about science , but i 'm now thinking , you know , a director must also lead to be a leader like a UNK or something .
but i did n't understand a lot of leadership before i UNK these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , `` what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what 's going on ? ''
these shy movies do n't get us money .
we just play the production capability , and of fame no trail .
all of you think i am between `` titanic '' and `` avatar '' and i would have had the nails tacked on a towel on a beach .
i 've all made these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money , what are you doing ?
you are doing it for the task , to the challenge , and the ocean is the UNK environment that there is , you are doing it , and because of the strange interaction that arises when a small group of people are forming a team .
because we 've done all this with only 10 to 12 people working for years , and sometimes we have two to three months at sea .
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have a choice that you have , because you have a task that you can not explain .
if you go back to country and say , `` we had to do it , the fiberglass , the UNK , and the whole world , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human UNK , when you work on the sea , '' then you can not just explain the other
there 's a connection that mutual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film `` avatar '' , i try to use the same message , which is that you respect his team and make it in return of respect .
it 's actually changed the dynamic .
so , i stood up with a small team on UNK play , and we turned `` avatar '' with a new technique that we did n't have before .
thank you very much .
a huge challenge .
and we have been a UNK for a four and a half years .
it changed my way of doing films , completely .
there were people who said we had actually UNK these UNK and UNK on the planet .
for me , it was more a UNK way to do my job , the actual process that changed the outcome .
so , what can we end up with all of that ?
what lessons did we learn ?
i think first of all , the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning of their teams is more important than all the UNK of the world .
to me , young filmmaker , who say , `` give me a advice to how to do that . ''
and i say , `` do n't UNK you yourself .
you get some other for you . do n't do yourself , bet on yourself , but take risks to you . ''
nasa has a UNK , `` failure is no alternative . ''
but in art , and in the art , we have to be an alternative , because there is a UNK .
no big endeavor , UNK innovation , has ever tackled that .
you have to be ready to take these risks .
this is the idea that i 'd like to share with you on the journey is a alternative , fear , but is no . thank you .
today i talk to you about energy and climate .
and it may be surprising , because my UNK in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seed , to make the things that we have to make , and to make the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
UNK means that their UNK ca n't grow over many years . it 's too much or too small , and things are going to change how it does n't change their fragile environment .
that leads to UNK . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate is going to be terrible for you .
it 's also very important for them .
the fact is , if you could only reduce the price of the price , energy would be energy by far most effective .
well , the UNK is like the time .
in fact , the UNK effect on UNK .
the UNK drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a UNK case in the UNK , and so we have refrigerators , UNK , we can make modern materials and make so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let 's get the price in half -- we hit a new barrier and this barrier is dependent on carbon .
co2 warmed the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it UNK the carbon fiber optic nerve , which leads to the UNK , and these UNK has some very negative effects of the weather , and perhaps worse , the extreme implications that the natural ecosystems can not adapt to these UNK changes and all the systems .
well , the exact link between a UNK and the resulting UNK and where the other follow instructions are , there are some UNK , but not very many .
and there are certainly UNK about how bad these consequences will be . but they will be extremely bad .
i said , `` well , we have to go to close to zero ?
is n't that half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature drops .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different to say , we have a 3.5 feet tall truck , which has to come up under a three feet bridge , and then you can actually fit it in underneath .
this has to go down , to zero .
well , we have a lot of UNK , over 26 billion tons .
every americans , about 20 tons , people in poor countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about five tons for every planet .
and somehow we have to change changes that reduce that to zero .
it 's been gone down now .
only different economic changes have actually influenced it , and we have to go from UNK increase to UNK and to zero to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little UNK . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- which is going to get to zero , and it will depend by the number of people , from the service that every man is using , the average energy for every
so let 's look at each one , and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of those numbers must come to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let 's go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today 6.8 billion people .
and it goes to 9 billion to move on 9 billion .
if we are very successful with new vaccines that are UNK and UNK , we may be able to reduce this to 10 percent by 15 percent , but at the time , we 're seeing a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that 's all the food we eat , clothing , heating , heating .
these are very good things and UNK means to make these services all over the planet .
it 's great that this number goes up .
in the upper world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do UNK and use less , but on average , this number is going to grow every year , and so on , more than double , the number of services that will be put on every person . EOS
here 's a very basic service . is there the light that you can read the homework ?
and these students do n't have it , so they go out and read their UNK under the UNK .
well , in efficiency , the energy per service , there 's good news .
we have something that does n't go up .
because of different successes in the UNK , through other forms of UNK , through new methods of UNK , there are lots of services that are getting a lot of money to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , as the manufacturing unit of UNK , 105 degrees -- UNK UNK or UNK or UNK , the UNK for improvement is very much less .
in fact , if we 're optimistic , maybe we get a reduction in a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now went from 26 billion to maybe 13 billion tons , and that 's just not enough !
so let 's take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a static place -- that 's the amount of carbon that is going to be UNK per unit .
it turns out that you can get this to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
when they burn natural gas , no .
almost every UNK of electricity is co2 , except for renewable energy and UNK .
so , what we have to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need UNK .
if i use the term `` wonder '' , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a wonder . the pc is a wonder .
the internet and services is a wonder .
the people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there 's no reason that you need a miracle to a certain date .
it 's usually just going to happen , and some people do n't come .
but in this case , we have to give UNK and make a wonder in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really do this ?
is there a natural place , an demonstration that UNK the idea of people here ?
i remembered the last year when i got UNK , and somehow people liked it .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , for energy , it fell .
i decided that the UNK of fireflies would be my UNK contribution to the environment .
so these are some natural fireflies .
they told me they did n't bite them . they would n't even leave the glass .
well , there are all sorts of things like this , but they do n't get a lot .
we need solutions , either one or several that have an incredible scaling and almost unimaginable strength , and although there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i have tides , UNK , UNK and biofuels .
these might be a UNK contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my point here is that we have to go to all of these five work , and we ca n't give up to them because they 're meaningful , because they all have significant problems .
let 's first see the burning fossil fuels , burning by either coal or natural gas .
and what you have to do is you seem to be easy , but it 's not . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of the UNK , you can catch up under pressure , and then you go somewhere , and you go somewhere , and you
there are a couple of UNK that can create that on a 60 percent , but it will get to 100 percent , but it will be very difficult , and a understanding of the UNK of carbon is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is the UNK .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something , which literally many billion times greater than any kind of garbage that you can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .
so that 's a hard thing to do .
next , UNK .
it also has three big problems , the cost , especially in UNK countries , and the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human cooperation that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because although it 's not very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that 's why you should work .
the last three of the five , i said .
it 's the renewables as they often be called .
and also , although it 's great , they need no fuel -- they have a few downsides .
one is the UNK that these technologies produce dramatically higher than the UNK .
these are UNK , you talk about many UNK times more than a normal power station .
also , these sources are UNK .
the sun does n't seem the whole day , it does n't appear either every day , and the wind does n't always replicate the wind .
and therefore , if you 're dependent on these sources , you have a way to get energy in times when it 's not available . EOS
so there are big UNK . there are challenges in the transmission , so if we say the energy source outside of the country , it 's not just the technology , they have to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
and there are UNK .
and to show that dimension , i 've made all kinds of batteries being created : the cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , for everything . and that 's what i 've done with the amount of electrical energy that the world is using ,
so we need a big breakthrough , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
that happens when you try to get these UNK sources about say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the world .
if you want to increase 100 percent on it , you need an incredible UNK .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project '' ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of companies .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
so many will say , you 're crazy ! that 's good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many who are already there . EOS
bill big has several companies , among other companies , which has great UNK .
UNK UNK invest in dozens of companies making great things and interesting possibilities , and i try to support that .
nathan UNK and i have a company that might be tracked for a nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in UNK , modular , liquid .
the development in this industry stopped at some time , so it 's not a big surprise that some good concepts lies around .
the UNK means that instead of a part of the UNK , one percent , the UNK , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the UNK .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate any reasonable whether it would work , but since there 's modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , you can simulate it and see that , yes , it looks like the right thing , it looks like it 's
and because you burn this 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the midden workers of today as UNK .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used to use it , a little like a candle .
you see that it 's a kind of pillar , often as `` the UNK wave of reactor . ''
it really solves the UNK .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the trash , which is 99 percent . you have the part that 's burned down today , so it 's called UNK uranium .
that 's the u.s. cost for hundreds of years .
and if you 're cheap and easy , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges there , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let 's think about how we should measure our success .
what should our accomplishment look like ?
well , let 's go to the target we have to do , and then we talk about the UNK .
a lot of talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it 's really important that we get there .
the other 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still a little agriculture , hopefully it will be UNK and cement to that .
so to reach those 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , have completely changed their climate change .
the other note says whether we use the UNK technology , whether it 's used in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get it to the rest .
that 's great important .
this is going to be a push of this problem .
if we go back from there , what should this look like by 2020 ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the UNK to get reduction in the way , the less we UNK , the lower will be the UNK and the temperature .
but in fact , this note of the things that we have , which are not going to lead to the big UNK , only in the same way , or even something less important like the other , which is the UNK of innovation to these breakthroughs .
we have to track these breakthroughs with UNK , and we can measure this : in UNK , in UNK and UNK .
there 's a lot of great books on this topic .
the al gore book , `` we have the choice , '' and david UNK `` UNK energy , the dirty air force . ''
they actually go through and create a framework that can be discussed , because we need the support of all pages .
there are some things that must come together .
that 's a wish .
a very UNK wish we can invent this technology .
if you want to get a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and that 's what i love , or i could choose this wish , which is a UNK , UNK UNK without co2 . that wish i would take .
this has the biggest impact .
if we do n't get this wish , the dig in between the long and short term , people will be horrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich countries , and almost every life of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what are the implications of that ?
we have to use it for more education .
if countries meet in places like UNK , they should not only talk about co2 .
they should talk to these UNK and they would be UNK from the ridiculous little money that are spent on these cutting-edge approaches .
we need UNK , carbon taxes , UNK and trade , which creates a UNK .
we have to spread the message .
we have to have the dialogue , and we have to have the things that are going to be done by government .
it 's a big wish , but i think we can do it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the big scientists , what we 've done , we need a few 10 million , and even if we test our materials in a russian nuclear reactor , that it works properly , it 's just in the UNK
the difficult step is to build more of the first UNK , more billion , the UNK and the place that actually build the first of it .
as soon as the first thing is , if it 's promised , it 's all clear , because the economy , the UNK is so different as we know it .
in order to understand that , that means deep into the ground , almost like a vertical column of nuclear UNK , that used to use that use , and then the process starts walking up and works on down ? EOS
bg : right . today , you have to UNK the reactor , so there are lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and make things like it , and it 's not good . it 's not good .
but if you have a cheap fuel , you can build it for 60 years -- think about a pillar that you bury , without all the UNK .
and it sits there and UNK 60 years and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution for the trash .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit there -- there 's a lot less crap with this technique -- then take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the garbage that exists in these UNK or UNK in the reactors . that 's our UNK .
so this is what these reactors have been a problem , what we have in our lives , and it will dramatically reduce dramatically during this process .
but while they were talking about different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest to make it happen ?
bg : well , we did n't have a place , and there 's a lot of interesting UNK for all the `` nuclear '' in name . there are big interest and people in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i talked about the minister , and i talked about
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese did something in the direction .
this is one of the things that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor , and some countries have built these , so everyone that has done a rapid reactor is a UNK for our first .
in your mind , UNK and probability of being in life ?
bg : well , we need one of these UNK , UNK things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to create , and then 20 years to use . EOS
so this is kind of the deadline that we have demonstrated that we have to do .
and , you know , UNK , if everything goes well , and that 's a big wish , it might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people who are working , as well as their approaches work , which works for their pilots to do it .
and it would be best if it could create several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the big breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a UNK is the UNK .
it would have been the UNK , but it 's also so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we do n't know their work as well as these , but there 's the modular technique , which is another approach .
there 's a little fluid that seems a little bit difficult , but maybe we 'll say it about us .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is that a UNK has a million times as much energy as one , say a UNK , and that 's why if you can deal with the problems , and it 's mainly the radiation , the impact on the country and the cost ,
if that does n't work , what ?
do we have to introduce UNK to try to make the UNK stable ?
bg : if you come in that situation , it 's as if you 've eaten too much , and just before a heart attack , what do you do ? you need a UNK or something .
there 's a UNK that 's called UNK , which are dealing with different techniques to grab the warming , so that we have been UNK 20 or 30 years to get around us .
it 's just a UNK .
you hope we do n't need that .
some people say , you should not just work at the insurance , because you do n't have a lazy way to eat , because you know that you 're going to eat the UNK .
i do n't know if it 's smart , if you take the importance of this problem in front of your eyes , but there 's a discourse about UNK about whether you should have that , if the things are coming faster , or that innovation takes more than we expect .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different haven .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
say that there are negative effects associated with the clouds that move things out ?
there are very , very few things you can actually say , which there are a chance in a million .
this is something like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of it .
and that 's why the idea is , if you have all sorts of problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and it comes from that investment is not so clear , and it 's not just the worst report , and there are people in the rich world , and there are
the fact is that that uncertainty should be worrying about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it perfect , and at the same time , the carbon UNK , then the skeptics said , `` okay , i 'm not interested in that there is no carbon fiber , i wish that it was n't
and that would be your answer to the UNK argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals of the world , the UNK , the UNK of malaria , and so on , it 's a stupid waste of resources to invest in
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion per year more than they do today -- it 's not that dramatically .
they should not suffer other things .
you come to big UNK , and you can disagree with sensible people , if you have something that is n't perfect , and try to fund that , and for me , the most waste is going .
because it is , you know , you 're very short of a UNK and funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much less expensive .
if the UNK you get , a very high UNK , then you can keep the rich up .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without change its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it 's a disaster .
and even UNK is thinking .
his new UNK is , `` why is n't the research going to talk about anymore ? ''
he 's still getting , because of his previous stories , with the UNK , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he 's going to get the UNK .
and that 's a UNK that i think is appropriate .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little it will be supported .
bill , i think , for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that their wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter UNK a UNK called `` the UNK . ''
the idea is quite simple . UNK have to have the biggest UNK structure of the structure with 20 UNK , about UNK tape , about UNK tape and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it .
and , although it really seems , it 's really hard , because people are pushing to work very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a UNK .
it was a huge success .
since i 've done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , UNK and architects , even with the UNK , and there 's something about this task , which enables deep insights into the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them with you .
usually most people start to orient to the task .
you talk about it , you think about how it will look , it 's UNK .
they then invest a little time in planning and organization , and they grab it out .
they invest a lot of their time in the UNK and UNK structures .
and finally , before you do n't have time anymore , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it onto the top , step back to the top , you get a step back and you put your work .
but then , almost always , what happens is that the `` UNK '' becomes a `` UNK , '' because the weight of the UNK is going to be UNK and UNK .
there are a range of people who have a lot more `` UNK '' than others , and under the worst , fresh UNK .
they lie , they cheat , they 're confused and they make really smart shapes .
and of course , there are teams who have a lot more `` UNK '' and the best of the UNK of the UNK .
and it 's quite amazing .
as peter told us , they do n't just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does that come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , `` none of the kids spend time in the head of the UNK UNK . ''
they do n't invest time in UNK .
but there 's another reason .
and that is that UNK were trained to find a good plan , ok !
and then you realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow onto the top , you have no time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what 's interesting about doing is that they 're starting to start the marshmallow and build prototypes , and they start with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have the opportunity to fix the UNK .
UNK recognize these kinds of collaboration as the core of a UNK .
and with each trial , the children get right feedback , which works and what does n't .
this is the performance of working with prototypes , but let 's see how different teams work .
the average for most of them lies at about UNK , which are half of those who are doing something more , but not much , they are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architect and engineers , thankfully .
UNK is the highest thing i 've seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and UNK patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceos are something about average . but here 's where it gets interesting .
if you get an annual gathering on the team , you get much better .
it 's incredible . you see and see `` this team will win . ''
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special capabilities of the UNK .
they have the process , they understand it .
and this team that regulates , and the work is going to improve the performance of the team .
UNK skills and UNK and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical UNK , you get about six , the resilient structures .
i was going to try something very fascinating .
i thought , let 's take the same thing .
so i offering a $ UNK price on software for the winners .
what do you think about that UNK ?
what was the result ?
this was happening . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone would have built a UNK construction , he would have worn the price at home .
so is n't it interesting that high speeds have a big effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
well , they understand the advantage of the UNK .
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they are produced the highest construction at all time .
so there are UNK lessons for us about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would someone actually invest time to create a UNK ?
the reason is , i will create digital tools and processes to help teams , to create cars , video games and `` UNK UNK . ''
and what the world is doing is they 're helping them hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or UNK , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can come visit .
it 's a blog where you see how to build the UNK .
there 's a UNK there .
they find crazy examples from all the world how people optimize the system and UNK .
it 's also UNK .
and the UNK lesson , i think , is actually a UNK sport .
it demands that we 're all about our senses at the task , and that we use our think optimal , like our emotions and our emotions , in the challenge that we face .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it takes to take us from a `` UNK '' -- to a `` UNK '' moment .
and that can make a difference .
thank you very much .
do we like we have a machine here ?
a big machine , a cool , UNK machine , and that 's a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i 've questioned my friends at the last time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back in time before they had cars or twitter or `` america . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of hijack nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of that group , i have to say .
i do n't want to go into the past , and that 's not because i am a UNK .
it 's because possibilities are not going back on this planet , they go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we 've ever existed on this planet , whatever we make : health , wealth , mobility , declining , declining . EOS EOS
it never had a time like this .
my mother died when they were 60 .
my grandparents had had this number on 70 .
my parents are about 80 on the continent .
so it should be better at the age of my UNK .
but it 's not just about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that 's born in new delhi is expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox eradicated smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they have changed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they 're gone . they are gone .
we UNK them . pop .
in the rich world , diseases that millions of us only have threat to one generation , hardly yet .
UNK , UNK , UNK ...
do anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , it works , if it does n't do it , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they have been often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people on this planet go to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and it 's embarrassing .
and not just that , we 've used our imagination to make this world safer .
drinking water , UNK land , rain , oil , gas : they disappear , and soon , and if we do n't get out of that chaos , we also disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live in , to rape .
i think we can feed this world with energy that they do n't break at the same time .
i think that 's true , and no , that 's not a wishful thinking .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night , and we 've never had to have any scientific progress , like now , never .
and we 've never been able to put it in the UNK , as we can today .
we are at the table of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds of 300 years back to the enlightenment , to find a time where we have progress , where we 've been fighting over these things , more EOS than now .
people are UNK in their faith , and that 's so deeply that you ca n't free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and you hear , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a right thing to do .
but you know where they 're not right ?
they have no right on their own facts . they do n't have them .
and i took a while to find out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about immunization for `` the new yorker , '' a little article .
and i was amazed to meet loads of resistance , which is the most effective performance in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know what to do , so i did just do whatever i do , i wrote an article and went back .
and soon , i wrote an article about UNK food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were getting crazy .
so i 've also written a article about it , and i could n't understand why people thought that it would be `` UNK , '' why they believed that molecules were based on a certain rather than a random jumble of nature .
but you know what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we type , we rich , we eat , that 's okay .
but these articles were worried me , and i could n't find out why , and eventually i found it .
and that 's because these UNK that made me nuts at all .
these were pious people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that got me so mess .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we are at a point where we do n't have the same relationship to progress , like earlier .
we 're talking about it .
we 're talking ironic about this , with little quotes : `` progress . ''
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there 's no reason why it should not be that .
you can just name a few name , and people will understand .
chernobyl , UNK , the UNK , UNK , mass destruction , the UNK of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we believed that they were always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , ask for some evidence .
take nothing in there .
but here 's where you have to get the evidence to adopt this evidence , and we 're not good at it . EOS
and i can say that from the reason we live in an epidemic of fear , as i 've never seen , and hopefully will never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horrible story that UNK the UNK , UNK , and UNK vaccine .
very scary .
tens of studies have been done to see whether this was true .
hundreds of studies should be done ; this is a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no association , no association , no .
it makes no difference . it does n't make a difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see what we see is that we feel real .
we do n't believe in a sack of documents from a UNK that 's us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was a little bit .
and because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the immunization rate increases for UNK .
this is a massive , and we should be ashamed of .
it 's terrible .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody UNK here ?
has a single one in the audience ever seen ?
does n't happen very often .
does n't happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times over the world in the last year .
that 's a lot of death by UNK , 20 per hour .
but because it does n't happen here , we can UNK it , and people like jenny UNK can go around and share of UNK and UNK of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do it because they do n't connect the cause and correlation .
they do n't understand these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that 's something we need to learn , and it 's very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he told us about one of the worst UNK of humanity .
no fear , no distress , UNK , UNK , gone .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he 's called paul UNK .
he just evolved a few other people .
he can save the lives of UNK 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , it 's good , except that paul UNK and talk about vaccines , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop .
and that 's actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public school , he ca n't tell a UNK of UNK .
he gets calling messages at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i do n't need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
if you go back , the diseases go back , horrible diseases , and that 's just happening .
we 've got UNK in this country .
and that gets worse , and quite soon kids will die again , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not only going to die in UNK .
what about UNK ? take that . why not ?
a UNK of me wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , `` i 'm a little too UNK .
nobody ever said that before .
she would n't get your child against UNK . absolutely no .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't have UNK . and you know what ?
we had no UNK in this country yesterday .
today , i do n't know , maybe a plane in lagos at a plane , and he 's flying in los angeles , right now he 's over a UNK .
and in a few hours , he lands and UNK a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's going to go to one of these UNK UNK tonight .
and he does n't know that he 's infected with a UNK disease , and we do n't know that , because that 's how the world works .
this is the planet we live on . do n't do it as if it 's not .
we love it to UNK . we love it .
did you all take their vitamins to the morning ?
UNK , a little UNK that does n't help you . EOS
i know you 've done that because half the americans make it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find that they 're useless .
the data shows that all the time .
they make their urine . they do n't do it .
that 's okay , you want to pay 70 billion dollars for dark urine .
thank you very much .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do it ?
well , i think , we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we have no faith in the system .
and that 's not what we should do . our health care system .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing and UNK itself to us who can afford it .
so we run away from , and where do we go ?
we 're running in the arms of the UNK .
that 's great . i love the UNK .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i 've got all sorts of little figures here .
none of it -- UNK , cheating , cheating , UNK , i do n't even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars for it , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people say to me and say , `` what cares ? let people do what they want .
that 's how they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it does n't matter whether it 's the minister of health that says , `` hmm , i 'm going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , '' or any UNK that wants to treat his patient with UNK .
if you get to the way that i believe and magic creates some magic and science , you get to a place where you do n't want to be .
they get to UNK UNK in south africa .
he took a lot of people around , because he insisted that red UNK , UNK and UNK are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can do the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of these disease .
do n't tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the UNK epidemic in which we 're at right now is this ridiculous struggle between the UNK UNK and the UNK .
this is a UNK debate . it must stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat , every UNK , every branch , every UNK , has changed from people .
you know , there were no UNK in paradise .
there were no cords .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we 've done it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of it works and some of it does n't .
we got rid of what did n't work .
now we can do it more specifically , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people to improve their lives .
you do n't want to do it ?
i have to say , i do n't understand that .
we refuse UNK food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i 'm listening to is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , UNK , we do n't want big fields with one thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't want companies to patent life .
we do n't want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer is all about ?
yes , they 're right . fix it .
it 's true , we have a huge UNK , but it 's not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it 's right , morality , UNK .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes does n't work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do it , because we 're afraid of a real dead , and it keeps millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than currently . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we do n't give them .
and why ? gavage changed food .
we 're not trying to encourage people to eat this UNK stuff , like UNK .
UNK is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's UNK .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and would n't be blinded .
they would n't starvation , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it would n't be UNK , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is : why are we fighting this ?
i mean , question , why are we fighting this ?
because we want to UNK genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on food , better food , more food .
it 's not about UNK UNK , it 's about getting people alive , and it will be time to understand what it means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do that , if we do so on , we do something about something that we do , i believe , not to be guilty , b colonialism .
there 's no other description for what happens here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not our UNK , and we have to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , `` do you want to go into this ridiculous game machine and go into the future ? ''
anyway . that 's what i want to do .
now it 's in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this time machine to all what we want .
we can UNK them where we want them to make them , and we will move them where we want .
we have to do these conversations , and we have to think , but if we go into the machine time and go into the future , we will be happy to have that .
i know that we can do it , and as far as it comes to me , this is something that the world needs .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 've been interested in the UNK . it may seem odd that a magician was interested in it , because , you look at it as a deception that is going to be something real , if somebody believes only enough of it .
in other words , UNK have shown a measurable effect in some trials , the UNK , and it 's just because the person thinks about what 's happening to them is a UNK or a kind of UNK , for example , if the patient is only UNK enough , it 's a measurable effect in the body
a deception becomes something true because somebody else it .
so let 's also understand each other , now i want to show you a fundamental basic magic trick .
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that is at least since the 1950s . EOS
i 've learned it from the UNK UNK magic in the 1970s .
i 'm going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i 'll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife they can study , my hand they can study .
i 'm just going to keep the knife in my hands .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing goes away from my sleeve or out of it , i just get my wrist on the right here .
in this way , you can see that no time moves on any time , as long as i 'm here , nothing can go into my sleeve or go out .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will fall through my bare physical UNK .
it 's actually sitting in the place that i can shake it , without the knife UNK .
nothing goes into my sleeve or it comes out , not UNK , and they can study everything .
UNK !
well , this is a trick that i often teach small kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look at a little bit , although it 's a very simple UNK trick .
i think many of you here in the room here in the room .
so here 's how it works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i UNK my wrist , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve appears or comes out , and that 's a lie .
the reason i UNK my wrist is that it 's the actual secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i UNK my hand of you , so you can see it from the back , this finger moves on , just from where he was , in a position that he was so extended .
great trick ?
there 's someone who had no childhood .
so , he 's sitting here . right .
and when i UNK , he changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't perceive that there 's only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that it works , it does n't matter , one , two , three , it 's
but this is why it 's actually not right now , and then i open my hand .
of course it will be written there , but not through the UNK of my body , but through a trick , through my UNK , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by showing myself , is going through this movement that the finger UNK itself .
i take this hand away . and here 's the knife .
that trick can show you your friends and friends . thank you .
well , what did that do with the UNK ?
one year ago , or so , i read a study that really changed me .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why it was an amazing thing to me .
and it turns out that if you provide a UNK in the form of a white pill in the form of a UNK , it 's just a round , white pill that has a particular measurable effect .
but if you take the shape where you give the UNK to a smaller pill , and you can make this blue , and make a letter on it , it actually is actually measurable .
and that , although not any UNK -- it 's just UNK .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really got me crazy .
but it turned out that it 's not all .
if you take it , it 's more more effective than pills every form .
a colored capsule that is at the end of yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the UNK plays a role .
a pill on a daily basis is not as good as three pills -- i ca n't remember that exact statistic . i 'm sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
well , that 's also a role of play .
and the shape plays .
and if you want to have the ultimate UNK , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a UNK -- a few UNK of a UNK substance that you have in a patient .
this creates a very powerful image in the head . it 's much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i 'll show you a different time when we have a UNK .
so the fact is that the white pill does n't work as well as the blue pill that does n't seem so good like an capsule that does n't seem so good like the needle .
and none of it has a really physical property . it 's just our belief that we can achieve a stronger effect .
i wanted to know whether i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i 'll take something that is obviously a deception , and let 's look at it really .
we know from the study that you have to grab onto the needle when it 's supposed to go .
this is an 18 inches of UNK . it 's very , very UNK , and i 'll start it a little UNK . EOS
this is really my meat . it 's not UNK , UNK meat .
this is my skin . this is not a UNK from hollywood .
i 'm going to put this needle in my skin and drive through it , until it comes back to the other side .
if you 're going to fall , if you fall easily in UNK -- i 've got a few friends last night in hotel room , and some people i did n't know , and it 's almost UNK .
so i propose if you 're going to get very bad , then look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i 'll do the first UNK part of the back .
you can see it in the same way , but if you want to .
so , it goes , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom part of my day , i just going to make a little UNK .
i 'm sorry . does it go crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we 're actually in the same situation we had in the UNK .
it 's about .
but now you ca n't count my fingers , right ?
so , i 'll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see that .
they say , `` okay , that 's certainly not so stupid , and UNK yourself the skin , just to entertain us a few minutes . ''
well , i 'll show you .
what does this look like ? quite well .
yeah , i know .
and people say , `` okay . i did n't see that right . ''
the people in the UNK come in .
let me show you that close .
this is really my skin . this is not a UNK from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can do it .
i 'm sorry . if you get bad , look away , look at it .
the people back in the back , the people who eventually see on video , say , `` well , it looks quite impressive , but if it would be real , it would be a hole and there , if it was really real , it would be
okay , let me get a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
usually i would take the needle .
i would make my arm and show you that there are no lesions .
but i think in this frame , and with intent , from a deception , i 'm going to just make the needle and go there and go on the stage .
we 're going to face a few times in the next few days .
i hope you 're happy . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have a number of people counting the number of books that were published with `` UNK '' in the last five years , and they gave up about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of interest in happiness .
there 's a lot of UNK .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this flood of work , there are several cognitive function that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive traps .
this is true of UNK , who think about their own happiness , and it 's for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we 're just as mess as everyone else .
the first of these traps is to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word is not just a useful word , because we can apply it to many different things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could do about it , but in the big and whole , the something that we have to give up , and we will have to embrace the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a sense of experience and memory : basically , they are between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or being happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both UNK in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the UNK , and that 's the unfortunate fact that we ca n't think about a situation that affects well-being without violating the importance .
i mean , it 's a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way to get it right .
now , i 'd like to start with an example of someone who had a UNK , after one of my lectures , which was a story . [ unclear ] -- he said he 'd have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and at the end of the shot , it was a UNK
and then he UNK , really emotional , which changed the whole experience .
but it did n't .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had UNK music .
they do n't know because he was UNK with a memory ; memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep on .
what we really say is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two species of self .
there 's a UNK self living in the present and the present knows , able to experience the past again , but basically the present .
it 's the UNK self , which is the doctor UNK -- you know , when the doctor asks , `` does it hurt if i put it here ? ''
and then there 's a UNK self , and the UNK self is that , the UNK and the story of our lives , and it 's one that the doctor is asking , `` how did you feel the question ? ''
or `` how was your journey to albania ? '' or something like that .
these are two very different entities , the UNK self and the UNK self , and making the two is part of the UNK of happiness .
well , the UNK self is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just tell stories , when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means that we have to keep track of our experiences is a story .
and let 's start with an example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who sit on a painful procedure .
i 'm not going to go into detail . she 's not painful anymore , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to cover every 60 seconds above their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they 're going to ask , `` who of two has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered . his UNK was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a patient had a patient , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much did these patients think they were fought ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a lot of UNK UNK to the UNK patient .
the stories of UNK were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very UNK or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and that , the worse thing was , where the pain was at the end , it was a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their UNK , and much later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and it was much worse than b for b in the UNK .
well , this is a direct conflict between the UNK self and the UNK itself .
from the point of view , b is clearly a UNK time .
now , what you could do with the patient a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it 's done , and it works , you could actually put the UNK of patient a cycle by just UNK the hose down without UNK to it .
this will lead the patient , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you make that the UNK self is a bad thing , and you have it that the UNK self is a much better at the patient , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what does a story do ?
and that 's true of the stories that the memory makes us and it 's true for the stories that we invent .
in fact , a story of UNK are , most moments and end .
it 's very , very important , and in this case , the end .
now , the UNK self lives in life .
it has moments of UNK , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to those moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i did n't know that -- you know , the psychological present is about about three seconds . what mean , you know , there 's about 600 million of these , there 's about 600 million of them .
most of you are completely ignored by the UNK self .
and yet , they get a sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of life .
it 's the limited resource we consume during the world .
and as we consume it , it seems to be important , but it 's not the story that keeps the UNK itself for us .
so we have the UNK self and the UNK itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is time .
from the point of view , when you have a vacation and the second week , it 's just as good as the first , then the UNK vacation is twice as good as the UNK vacation .
this is not how it works at all .
it 's a little bit better than the UNK holiday on vacation , because there 's no new memory .
they have n't changed the story .
and in this way , it 's actually the critical variable that a UNK self is different from a UNK self , and time has very little impact on this story .
now , the UNK self does more than remembering and tell stories .
it 's actually one that meets the decisions , because if you have a patient , we say two UNK at two different surgeons , and you decide which he 's supposed to choose , then the guy who has the memory that is less bad , and that 's the surgeon who will be selected .
the UNK itself has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we do n't choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we do n't think of our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a UNK memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the UNK itself , and you can think of the UNK itself as a one , which is a UNK self , which is a UNK self , by experience that the UNK self does n't need .
i have a sense that if we 're doing vacation , this is a very common case , which means we 're doing holidays in the services of the UNK . EOS
and that 's a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the UNK itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often in terms of how often i think about other UNK .
and i probably have my memories of this UNK journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i 've ever had the dodo skeleton with the 600 pictures that i 've spent one more hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's a day for a half .
there seems to be a disagreement .
well , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the UNK of memories , but even if you do more of it , there 's a real question . why do we give memories so much weight versus the weight that we give
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the web , all of your UNK are UNK , and you get a UNK drug , so you will not remember anything .
well , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose one other vacation , there 's a conflict between the two species of self , and you have to think about how they decide that conflict , and it 's really not obvious , because if you think of time , you get an answer , and if you think of memories , you
why we choose the UNK that we choose is a problem that makes us choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self throw two words from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of them .
so you can ask , how happy is that ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the life ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we 're capable of getting a pretty good idea from the happiness of the UNK itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the UNK self , it 's a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it 's how satisfied or delighted that person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anybody who is not different from these words , the study of happiness , and i belong to a lot of researchers about well-being that UNK the study of happiness , in exactly this kind .
the distinction between the happiness of the UNK self and the happiness of the UNK self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you try to measure the two .
the UNK organization has asked a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there was other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the first lesson we have , i believe , is that they are really different .
you can know how someone speaks to his life , and it 's not a lot about how happy he lives his life and the vice versa .
just to give you a sense of correlation between correlation , correlation is about UNK .
what that means if you would meet someone , and you would say , oh , his father is a UNK , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody is living as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his UNK himself .
so correlation is small .
we know something about what the happiness of the UNK is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness mainly means to be content with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other delight , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you will do very different things .
and the conclusion what i 've said here is that we should n't really think of ourselves as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely different term .
well , in short , another reason we ca n't think about happiness is that we do n't think about the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are not going to get the right answer .
if you think about this question , people have to be happier in california when they are , say , in a UNK .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the UNK itself , and it 's not even very important for the UNK self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the UNK self is responsible , you can pull out at the end -- some people might pull back to california .
and it 's kind of interesting to follow , which happens to people that are going to california that are going to be happier .
well , you ca n't get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you will think that you 're happier , because if you think about it , you will remember how awful the weather was in ohio , and you will feel that they have hit the right decision .
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i 've got a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you very much .
now , when we went back a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this UNK survey .
is this something that you can teach us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel UNK : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the UNK survey is a number which we did n't have to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness of the UNK self .
if we were looking at how emotions UNK the income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big representative sample , but a income of 1.2 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they 're getting increasingly happy , the poorer they will .
it 's a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i 've rarely seen that flat lines .
what happens , obviously , is that money did n't raise a consumer sensibility , but that lack of money bought a certainly of UNK , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , of course , you get another story .
the more money you earned is you get more .
it 's not for emotions .
but danny , the entire american effort is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people would take a seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of UNK and so on .
is there a chance that politicians would generally take a finding like the seriously , and do it based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there 's a role for the role of politics in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it 's happening , and in other countries it 's happening .
people are to acknowledge that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will be able to discuss whether they want to study their UNK or whether they want to study UNK , so we have to do this debate quite soon .
and as you get lucky , very differently depending on how you think and whether you think about the UNK self or whether you think about the UNK self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you have to measure the UNK of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me this topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny UNK .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i make video games .
i think for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as it is in UNK .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including them all , more time playing games and playing games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with UNK .
some of you may think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
maybe a little too much time , if you think about how many problems we have in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i did n't know that it took time at the age of 21 billion hours per week .
this might be a little bit more interesting first , so let me think about it , if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 10 billion hours a week .
no , i mean , really seriously .
why ? this picture is really exactly why i think games are so critical to the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer UNK UNK .
he wanted to catch the feelings of play , so he made a camera before the players .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
if you 're not a player , you may be able to hear some of the UNK in this picture .
you 're probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also a lot of concentration , which is a really difficult problem to solve .
if you 're playing , you see some UNK here , which are up at the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrow shows the surprise .
this is a player that says on the edge of a so-called UNK UNK .
oh , you know that . ok , well , so we have some players here .
a UNK victory is a result , which is so much positive that they did n't know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they reach it , they 're shocked that they are actually able to do that . this is a UNK victory .
this player is just a UNK victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces across the world , when we take the UNK of the next century , and the face of people standing on the brink of all odds on the edge of the UNK .
well , unfortunately , we see this kind of face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it as `` in life , i 'm bad , '' and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok ?
that 's me , like , `` in life , i 'm doing bad . ''
this is a graffiti in my former middle school in berkeley , california , where i was in my research , why we are better in play than in real life .
that 's a problem that many players have .
we think we 're not as good as play .
and i do n't just mean less , even though that is . EOS
we reach more . i mean , in the context of motivation , the motivation to do something meaningful is inspired by collaboration .
if we are in a UNK , i think many of us will turn into our best version , anytime and immediately , to try to solve the problem , as long as required , it tries to try to make it back .
and in reality , if we fail , if we collide in obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel embarrassed . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or UNK .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , it just does n't exist .
and that 's what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think that you could n't do everything ?
how can we make these emotions out of play in reality ?
so i looked at games like warcraft of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collective problem problem .
and i 've found some things that make epic journey in UNK .
so , first of all , when you get into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a UNK mission , and that 's immediately .
but not just a mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in play , right ?
so , create that .
they never get a task that they ca n't solve .
but always on the edges of their capabilities , so they have to work . but there are no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not sitting around and you 're UNK . there are always specific to do something important .
and there are tons of employees .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to close their epic mission .
we do n't have the real life in the real life , that feeling that there are lots of tons of employees who are willing . EOS
and then there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have heard of `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
that constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i do n't have to talk about plus-one and plus-one crazy idea , UNK crazy idea .
i get the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of UNK like world of warcraft is that it 's so scary to stand at any time on the edge of a UNK , that we 'd rather spend our time in these UNK .
they are just better than the reality .
until today , all of the world 's world has spent four million years to solve the virtual problems of UNK problems .
it 's not necessarily bad .
it sounds bad .
but in order to see it in context : five million years ago , our first UNK started walking upright .
so the first thing is .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on games , it only makes sense when you keep the time in terms of the time of human development , which is extremely common .
but also , right . because it turns out that we 're using this whole time to play , actually changing what we 're capable of as people .
we 're developing to each other , very creatures .
that 's the truth . i believe that .
look at this interesting statistic that was published recently from a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young man in a country with powerful UNK spends 10,000 hours with UNK to the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , UNK hours , the exact same sets that they spend in school , from the five to school , from high school to high school -- if you never do .
so , we have a complete disconnect here , where young people are also learning what it means to be a good player , like anything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book from malcolm gladwell , `` UNK , ''
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it 's based on the great science of UNK , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the main goal of a single subject to the 21st century , we will be too far .
we 're going to be so good at doing whatever the most famous people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are UNK .
so the big question is , `` what are you doing ? ''
because if we could find out that , we would never have a human potential for that .
so many people now have in the world that spend at least one hour a day with UNK .
these are our UNK , 500 million people who are extraordinarily well in `` something . ''
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary well in whatever .
if you have n't heard it yet .
the UNK evolved to save energy and work on UNK , instead of the UNK , that players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil can play online .
you expect a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion player .
so i started to think about what is what it is that we 're doing these games .
here 's the four things i found . first , UNK .
ok , think of it as extreme UNK .
UNK is the desire to make a challenge immediately , with the belief that we have a UNK hope for success .
players always believe that a UNK victory is possible , and it 's always worth trying to try and try it . EOS
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in the atmospheres of social networks .
there 's a lot of interesting research , which show that we love people more after we 've played them , even if they have failed us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with somebody else .
we trust that someone will spend time with us that the rules are going to be UNK that we have the same goal , and to the end .
so it allows us to grow the problem of bonds , trust and trust .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
UNK productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the UNK of the UNK of UNK 22 hours a week , sort of , as a UNK .
the reason is that when we play , we are actually happier at working hard , as if we 're relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings work optimal , when we do hard to do great work . EOS
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to get part of the UNK of the UNK magnitude .
here 's a UNK to back in the right light , you know all wikipedia , the biggest UNK of the world .
the second thing in the world with almost 80,000 chapters is the world of warcraft UNK .
five million people use it every month .
they have collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in any other world in the world .
they 're creating a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who lead to a single outcome . players are UNK , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that 's the problem i try to solve .
now edward UNK is a UNK .
his work is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in UNK .
and he says , `` we 're not going to get more than a UNK in virtual worlds and virtual worlds . ''
and this is from an economist . so it 's logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i think games , i 'm a little UNK .
so he says that this makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
they can create stronger social bonds than the real life , they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it 's perfectly logical that players are in the virtual world as in the real world . EOS
i 'm just waiting , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not a UNK .
we have to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event called 2,500 years ago .
there 's this ancient cubes of UNK . you know ?
before these fantastic UNK , there was UNK .
and these were actually the first of people developed UNK . EOS
and if you 're familiar with the UNK of the old greek UNK , you may know that story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to UNK games , games have been invented in the kingdom , in the kingdom of a famine .
supposedly , there was a great famine that the king of UNK came to a crazy idea .
people fought . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it took a extreme solution .
so they invented , loud , UNK , UNK , and a national strategy , and a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the UNK way , because games are so fascinating , and we have UNK productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to UNK , they survived these days by eating them on a day and played on the next .
the same thing , i think , are playing games today .
we are playing games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we are playing games to avoid everything that does n't work in the real world , especially in the real life , and we 're not going to get what we need to play .
but it does n't have to be the end .
this is the exciting thing .
UNK , after 18 years , famine did n't get better , so the king decided to UNK a last UNK .
they divided the kingdom in two halves .
they played a UNK , and the winner could blow up to a UNK adventure .
they left UNK , and they went to search for a new home , and they were doing so many people back how it was food to survive , and they were looking for the rest after a neighborhood where they were thriving .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but latest UNK shows that the UNK that later , the UNK of the UNK , the same dna as the old UNK .
and so scientists came to the notion that UNK ' fantasy is actually true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years to explain what it would be like .
so this crazy story might be true .
maybe they actually saved their people through games by making 18 years in games , and then they had these UNK , and so much about what they learned was that they had saved the whole civilization .
so , we can .
we 've been playing in 1994 .
this was the first UNK in the world of UNK , which was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years long , we 've been playing video for 16 years .
i think we 're ready for our own UNK game .
so they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21st century UNK per week .
we should have hoped that half of us spend an hour a day with games until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you 're going to ask , `` how do we solve problems in the real world ? '' and that 's exactly why i 've devoted my work to the future for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , where we should understand the future .
we do n't want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to think about the best thing , and then people tend to make this idea into reality .
we 're taking epic journey , and we give people the opportunities to reach them .
i 'm going to show you three games that i designed to try to try to make people epic journey in their own future .
this is `` world without oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a UNK where you have to get through a UNK .
the UNK is invented , but we have enough UNK , so it will be realistic for it , and it actually lives the real life without oil . so , if you look at the game , tell us where they 're living , and then they 're going to be able to
we 've test this game with UNK players in 2007 , and we 've been UNK it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an changing experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you 're in a UNK adventure , and you say , `` we 're going to get the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure that you go on .
find out how they were going to survive , most of our players are doing this in the game .
so , we have a higher risk of play , a bigger one more aim than just UNK .
we 've developed the game for the future for the future .
it 's the calculation of one that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called `` global UNK UNK , '' of course .
the call to players , to sign up , we have designed almost like a `` UNK . ''
you know jerry UNK , where it is `` UNK '' -- they have the astronauts , the scientists , the UNK , and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , say , everyone is in the UNK , and it 's our task , the future of energy , food , health , security , and the future of social justice .
8,000 players play the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they 're UNK .
and the last game we get at UNK . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get from the world bank , `` social UNK , '' by 2010 .
we work with universities in all sub-saharan africa , and invite them to learn social landscape .
we have a comic book about it . we have `` level of '' for UNK , UNK , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i 'd like to invite you to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in UNK , which benefit from them together to create their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something . EOS
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we have n't saved the real world .
well , i hope they agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we 've got these all these superpowers , UNK productivity , the ability to create narrow social networks , UNK , and the desire to UNK .
i really hope that we can play great games to survive on this planet a more century .
and i hope they will play with me like that and play .
if i go back in the next decade , i 'm sure we can create any UNK future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let 's start the UNK games .
thank you .
i 'd like to tell you something about what a few months ago when i was writing a paper for UNK wired .
i 've always been writing my life , but i 've been working with the edit of the computer , and i noticed that i 've never seen my life , which is what the word `` UNK '' means .
i 'll read you the post .
`` UNK , '' `` UNK , helpless , useless , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ,
UNK : healthy , powerful , powerful . ''
i was reading this list of a friend loud , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up to `` UNK , '' and i could n't go to read , and i had to go to read , and i had to start to read , and
of course , this was a UNK , old UNK , and i just felt that the copy has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early 1980s when i started working with the elementary school , and i started to build my sense outside of my family experience and shape , also in terms of other kids and the other world around me .
and god is , i did n't use a UNK at the time .
if i would take this point seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me as a person whose lives can be done in a UNK way , but now i 'm going to have the opportunity and adventure that i 've experienced .
so i immediately went to the UNK of 2009 , and i expected that i found a UNK contribution .
this is the UNK version of this UNK .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
and in particular , the last two words are called `` near UNK , '' `` very , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about words .
it 's about what we think about the people we describe to these words .
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language determines our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of UNK societies , including the greek and the romans , really believed that the UNK of a UNK has a big force , because what you can find out loud .
so , what do we want to do -- a UNK people or a powerful person ?
in fact , a human being UNK as a child , it could be UNK and UNK them and UNK them .
would n't it be nice to open you doors ?
a man who opened the doors for me was my pediatrician in the UNK UNK institute in UNK .
he 's called dr. UNK . a UNK , whose name , as you can think of , most americans do n't have an answer , so he 's always been called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always sitting very colorful , and it was just for children with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my UNK .
i did n't have to make any exercises at infinite speed with these UNK , UNK UNK -- in various colors -- you know , to build my UNK , and i hated that UNK more than anything else . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it
and imagine that i 've been working with dr. p. UNK , and so i try to stop these exercises without success .
and one day he was watching me at one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tiring and make-up -- and he said to me , `` wow , UNK , you 're such a strong , powerful and young girl , you 'll get one day one day . EOS
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
and that was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. UNK , so that i do n't want to do the exercises that i do n't want to do , with the prospect that the five year-old girls are going to be in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily contact with new eyes , and
and i wonder today , how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl has changed my self , and i could imagine myself as a nature of nature from powerful , powerful and UNK people .
this is just one example of many , how adults can manage the imagination of a child .
but as we 've already heard examples of the UNK , our language does n't make a space to imagine what we all wish to do : it would allow everyone to make themselves as powerful people .
our language is behind the societal changes that were triggered in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the UNK for UNK , UNK of titanium and artificial UNK for the human body that people will allow us to make really all their possibilities , and to define their own identity , to make their own
so perhaps this technical change is clear because the fact that there are always a different truth , which is that every human being able to make something very UNK and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to tell me how to deal with odds , and i 'll give you a hint : this sentence has never been UNK for me , and i 've always been very uncomfortable with trying to answer the questions of people , and i EOS i
this sentence about transformative odds with odds of the idea that success or luck is dependent upon a challenge , not to become a challenge , as if my life could be so successful , because i could have been so successful , because i was able to make a EOS of life with a prosthetic arm , or whatever
but the truth is that we are changing ourselves . of course we are by the challenge , whether they 're physically , emotionally or even both .
and i think that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle that we have to do to make our lives better .
odds are just part of our lives .
and i tend to see more stressed than my shadows .
sometimes i realize he 's very present , sometimes he 's barely seen , but he 's always on me .
and i do n't want to have the impact , or the heavy of the UNK of a human being .
there are differences in life and challenges , and they 're just UNK , and every person goes different to it , but the question is not whether we 're going to come to adversities , or not , but how we get to it .
so we 're not just responsible for the people we love to preserve , but they also prepare for getting good at it .
and we do n't love our kids , if we give them the feeling they ca n't adapt .
you have to make two things clear : one of the medical fact to be an amputee , and to the other people think about whether i am disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability , which i had to put myself apart , is that the world is constantly thinking , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our wish , to protect the people who are in our hearts , and the cool thing to do about their medical progression or even a forecast on the quality of life that they 're expected , we have to keep the basis for someone who is actually UNK
perhaps the current concept , which is only true that is in a UNK , and how we fix that , for every single one of the greater disability than the UNK .
if we ca n't treat a human being , and not to perceive all of his forces and possibilities and account , we can create the natural struggle that you might have to do , another disease .
we have a people who has a value for our society .
so we have to look at the UNK , and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it 's between the perception of our strengths and our great ingenuity , a connection .
we should not be able to UNK these challenging times , or UNK , we should not try to avoid them , but we should not return them under the carpet , but it 's about recognizing the odds of odds .
it may be more likely to make sure that we do n't necessarily have to get rid of it , but that we 're open to embrace it , to embrace it , to actually take a UNK , and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we can make it more stressed as a natural , coherent and useful and useful , and we 're not being able to do so through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 of the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my view , suggested something very true in human nature .
i would say this : not the power of his species , and also not the UNK of his species , but the thing that can adapt the world .
out of conflict , creativity comes from .
not just from darwin 's work , we know that the capacity of people , to survive and UNK , from the struggle of the human mind , is governed by conflict .
so , again , change and UNK are the great skills of people .
and maybe we can do n't know where wood we are , when we 're really going to get tested .
perhaps that 's the sense of otherness , a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a little more .
we can give up a new meaning that goes beyond the heavy times .
maybe we can see more variability than change .
odds are a change that we have not adapted to .
i think the biggest harm we have to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
well , who is normal ?
there 's no normal normal .
there 's the usual sort of thing . the typical car , but not the normal , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if they were really there ?
i think it 's not .
it would be great if we have this paradigm of normal against a different kind of possibility or the strength , to make it even a bit more dangerous , we could share the forces of very many kids , and they invite them to invest their very special and valuable skills into society .
UNK have found that we have always cited people from the members of our society : useful to be useful and making a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals , many years ago , older people and people with severe physical injury , have worn away , and it might have happened because the life experience was so valuable in the UNK of these people .
they have n't considered these people as broken and useless ; they have been treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city that i was raised in , in the red line in the red line , in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in a UNK tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had UNK .
and i hear a guy behind me says , `` well , if that 's not UNK . ''
and i turn around and see that older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , `` excuse me , sir , do we know ? i ca n't remember them . ''
and he said , `` well , you ca n't remember me .
when i first saw her , i got her out of her mother . ''
oh , so .
and of course it did .
this was dr. UNK , a man that i only knew from narratives of my mother about this day because i was of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the physician for UNK diagnostics of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without UNK , and my feet were looking at them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes at the other foot , he was the UNK , that stranger had to make the bad news .
he said to me , `` i had to say your parents to say you never going to walk , and you will never be as smart as other kids , or you ca n't have a independent life , and then they have to lie to me . ''
it was really extraordinary , i found that he was raised in my entire childhood , whether i had won in a UNK in the second grade , whether i was working with the UNK at the UNK , whether i had my scholarship or one of my UNK UNK , and he was using these clips to teach their students , from the harvard medical school , and
and he called this part of his name , the x factor , the potential of the human willing .
you ca n't just point enough how critical this factor can be for the quality of a human being .
and dr. UNK told me , he said , `` i 've learned that kids , if they do n't get any other , and even if they get a little support , when you get their kids yourself , then kids can achieve very much . ''
see , dr. UNK has changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone could do it , two different things .
and also , i 've changed my thinking over time , if you have asked me at the age of 15 , whether i had my UNK against legs of meat and bone , then i would have no second .
i did n't want to be normal at the time .
if you ask me this today , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's because i 've experienced something with my legs and not despite that experiences .
and perhaps this change could happen because i had so many people who opened me on the doors , rather than to encounter people who want me to raise my vision or me .
see , it really takes a people who show you how they can UNK their forces , and they are through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , inner forces , the human mind is so UNK -- if you create that , and for someone in a critical moment , you open up a door , then you 're a very good teacher .
they get them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word `` UNK '' is rooted in the word `` UNK . ''
it means to create something that is in one , the potential .
again , what would we want to do in this ?
in the '60s , in the united states , they were UNK a UNK , and they were transformed in UNK .
they call this `` UNK UNK '' in the united states , which is what we call `` UNK . ''
students are broken to grades .
and the a student will get harder seriously , get the better teachers and so forth .
they then have a UNK record of students with a UNK class , and the note said , `` very well , '' they were told they were very smart , and after these three months they were really UNK .
and of course , to hear a heart , that vice versa , the other way , they said it was just sufficient .
and it was also in the three months .
but only those who were still in school , apart from the students who had the school .
it was very key to this study that the teachers were not UNK .
the teachers did n't know anything changed .
they were just told that be the student , and they are the students at the class , and they have to teach them something and treat them .
the only real disability is a broken mind of a mind that has broken , no hope anymore . he finds nothing more . he lacks our natural , childish curiosity , and our innate capacity of imagination .
but if we do it , to support the human spirit , continue to hope , to hope and to find other people around it , to be curious and UNK , we actually put our forces really positive .
if a mind of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new UNK .
i 'd like to end with a poem that was written by a grocery poet called UNK in the 14 century , and by which my friend jacques UNK talks about . and the poem is , `` the god who only knows four words , '' not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
