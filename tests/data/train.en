Teenage youngster "nico videos are uncool, so I don't watch them". I thought from the start it wasn't really for people in that young of an age bracket. My impression is of otaku middle aged guys getting excited about them. Or, in the past was it cool? Hmm?

December 29, the New York Times used the first and eighth pages to publish the long article "She Broke Japan‚Äôs Silence on Rape". The article was about how the mainstream Japanese media turns a blind eye. We need to break down the silence regarding rape in Japan (NYT article translation). It is being broadcast online. People who only watch the mainstream media in Japan won't be reached even if the NYT reports on it. Is it even conceivable that a NYT broadcast could bring about a change to the mainstream Japanese media? Well, I guess it basically has no effect.

The tale of the death of 1984. It seems very realistic and one has no need to think or get confused when brainwashed. Where or not that is happiness is another matter altogether.

Tick that attacked dinosaurs one hundred million years ago discovered. Preserved in amber immediately after sucking blood. The first thing that comes to mind for dragons is Francis Drake, but I wonder if the nickname came from Spain... When I heard "Drake" I also remembered that there was a Saab Draken fighter plane, but this also is from the Swedish dragon "Mandrake" or "Mandragora". These types of words also have to do with dragons. How interesting.

2017 New Year's specials. NHK "Kouhaku". Nippon TV "Gaki no Tsukai". TV Tokyo "Kodoku No Gurume". This is just my opinion, but those who hold TV Tokyo in high regard seems to be the same people who like Kouhaku, so it might be a fierce competition.
